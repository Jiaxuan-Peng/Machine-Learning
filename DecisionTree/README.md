how to use your code to learn decision trees

The tree code was built in ID3.py
import the tree with "from ID3 import DecisionTree"

use the code below to call the algorithm:
DecisionTree(gain=i, max_dep=j,labels=y_train,x_dic=x_dic) where i could be changed into ("EP", "ME" or "GI"), j could be set as a positive integer.
